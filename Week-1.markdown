# Database Management Systems (Week 1 Notes)

## 1. Introduction to DBMS
A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software that provides systematic storage, retrieval, and management of data in an organized manner. It serves as an interface between the user and the database.

### Why Databases?
Databases are used to manage large amounts of data efficiently in various applications such as:
- Banking (Transactions)
- Airlines (Reservations)
- Universities (Registrations, Grades)
- E-commerce (Order Tracking)
- Manufacturing (Inventory Management)

### Drawbacks of File Systems
Before DBMS, file systems were used to store data, but they had several limitations:
- Data Redundancy & Inconsistency
- Difficulty in Data Access
- Data Isolation
- Integrity Problems
- Atomicity Issues
- Concurrent Access Problems
- Security Issues

## 2. DBMS Abstraction Levels
DBMS provides **three levels of abstraction**:
- **Physical Level**: How data is stored physically.
- **Logical Level**: Describes what data is stored and its relationships.
- **View Level**: Describes only a part of the database (used for security or simplicity).

## 3. Data Models
A **Data Model** is a collection of concepts used to describe data:
- **Relational Model** (Focus of this course)
- Entity-Relationship Model
- Object-Based Models
- Semi-Structured Models (XML)

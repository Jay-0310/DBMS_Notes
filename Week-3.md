# Week 3 Lecture Material Summary

## Database Management Systems

### **Reference Book**
- Database System Concepts, 6th Edition by Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan

## **Module 11: Advanced SQL**

### **Recap of Week 2**
- Introduction to SQL: History, DDL, DML
- Basic Query Structure, Set Operations, Aggregate Functions
- Intermediate SQL: Joins, Views, Transactions, Integrity Constraints
- SQL Data Types and Authorization

### **Module Objectives**
- Understanding SQL usage from a programming language
- Functions and procedural constructs in SQL
- Triggers and their applications

### **Topics Covered**
1. **Accessing SQL from a Programming Language**
   - APIs like JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
   - Embedded SQL usage in C, C++, Java, and Python
   
2. **Functions and Procedures in SQL**
   - SQL:1999 standards
   - Table-valued functions
   - Stored procedures and their advantages
   
3. **Triggers**
   - Concept and implementation
   - Before and after triggers
   - Use cases and when to avoid triggers

## **Module 12: Formal Relational Query Languages**

### **Topics Covered**
1. **Relational Algebra**
   - Operators: Select, Project, Union, Set Difference, Cartesian Product, Rename
   - Examples and practical applications
   
2. **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**
   - Non-procedural query language using predicates
   - Safety conditions for expressions
   
3. **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**
   - Similar to TRC but uses domain variables
   - Query expressions and their equivalence to algebra
   
4. **Equivalence of Algebra and Calculus**
   - Demonstrating how relational algebra and calculus queries produce the same results

## **Conclusion**
- SQL integration with programming languages enhances database interactions.
- Functions, stored procedures, and triggers help in database automation.
- Formal relational query languages provide theoretical foundations for SQL operations.
